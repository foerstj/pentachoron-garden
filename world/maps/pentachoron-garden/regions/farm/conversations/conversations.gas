Well, there's basically three parts: we're in the Vale, which is the nicest part of it to have a walk. I recommend you to just follow the Brook down to the Inn - greet our junior if you see him there.
Then there's the Woods, and behind them lies the Mount. Be a bit careful if you wander through the Woods, and especially up on the Mount. Also, take some warm clothes with you, it's usually covered in snow up there.";
