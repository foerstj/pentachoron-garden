Have you heard the shdory of Lord Hovard and Lady Ashish already? If you have been to the Inn, you mosht brobably have. It'sh all nonsense talg from that glub of wannabe hishtorians, believe me. This Garda ish the only good thing they ever made. Hovart wash evil, and mad. It wash nod the influence of that Utraean sorceress Ashish, and of course also nod the machig of the Badlands as some peoble glaim. And Ashish wash, if anything, even more evil than him, and from the shdard. She wasn'd turned evil by the evil Utraeans. Now the Utraeans weren'd the good ones either of course, bud when they capchured her they found a mind that was unhealable, that's why Ashish was then used in their shbider egsberimends. Evil to the bone, both of them, bud nowadays peoble talg like it wash all a romandig trachedy...";
