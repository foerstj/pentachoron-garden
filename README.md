A little map for Dungeon Siege 1.

## About
A little map I made for Dungeon Siege.\
Set in an enchanted place that once was a manorial garden.\
Character level starting at 0 going up to Glacern / Fallraen level.

Stats & feats: 16 regions, ~2 dozen NPCs, all shop types (magic, smith, mules), 5 hireables, 20 quests. Non-euclidean geometry, teleport system, German translation, optional custom music.

While Ehb is an epic linear journey, Pentachoron Garden is open-world and more quirky.\
Enjoy your time in the Garden!

## Installation & Compatibility
- This map does not require LoA.
- To install, simply put the .dsmap file in the Maps folder and the .dsres files in the Resources folder.\
  Or put them all in the DSLOA folder if you use DSLOA.
- The "de" .dsres file is optional and contain translations into German, which will be picked up if you have a German installation.
- The "music" .dsres file is also optional and contains nice custom music. It will default back to original Dungeon Siege music if this file is missing.
