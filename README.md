## Installation
- To install, simply put the .dsmap file in the Maps folder and the .dsres files in the Resources folder.\
  Or put them all in the DSLOA folder if you use DSLOA.
- The "de" .dsres file is optional and contain translations into German, which will be picked up if you have a German installation.
- The "music" .dsres file is also optional and contains nice custom music. It will default back to original Dungeon Siege music if this file is missing.
- To uninstall, simply remove the files again :)
